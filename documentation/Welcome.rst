^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


You have the choice between a lot of different XMPP providers. Your XMPP address will be the username you choose followed by the @-sign and the domain of the chosen provider.

Some examples for XMPP providers are:

magicbroccoli.de: Registration (`external <https://magicbroccoli.de/register/>`__ ). 
wiuwiu.de: Registration (`external link <https://wiuwiu.de/>`__ ). 
You can also choose a provider by looking at this list: (`external <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/Beagle-im/id1153516838>`__ ). 

If you do not know any XMPP server domain names, then you could select one of trusted servers from `here <https://list.jabber.at/>`__

Now you select Sign in to an existing XMPP account since you already registered an address in the previous section. Afterwards, you have to enter your XMPP address, your password and finish these steps by clicking "Log in". Please keep in mind that in this tutorial the XMPP address userfortest2023@xmpp.jp is used as an example account.
